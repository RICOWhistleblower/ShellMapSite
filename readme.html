    <h1>MASSEY SERVICES, INC.: A RECKONING</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Led by Rev. Jacquelyn Baker — Ordained Minister, Witness-Bearer, Keeper of the Record</p>

    <div class="scripture-quote">
      “Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.”<br>

      <p class="mission-body">
        This project is not mere code. It is sacred commission. It stands upon theological ground—not policy, not politics. When systems retaliate, this archive refuses to flinch. It is led by one who walks the path of Esther, Deborah, Ruth, Paul, David. The record is unsealed. The oppressors are named. The truth will be preserved until life itself is required to silence it.

    <h2>Purpose & Mandate</h2>
    <p class="mission-body">
      This archive exists to expose misconduct, preserve whistleblower testimony, resist systemic retaliation, and sanctify every submission beneath the authority of scripture. The Lord is the defender. Rev. Baker is the vessel. This is a theological act of digital resistance.

    <p class="mission-body">
      Submissions are protected under federal statute, including 18 U.S. Code § 1513. Technical architecture ensures digital evidence remains court-admissible, and encrypted forms shield the testimony of the oppressed.
