# MASSEY SERVICES, INC.: A RECKONING

## 🙌 Stewardship & Calling

**Repository Curator: Rev. Jacquelyn Baker**  
**Ordained Minister | Witness-Bearer | Defender of Testimony**

This archive is not simply code. It is sacred commission.  
Curated by a servant ordained in faith, this project stands on theological ground—not organizational policy.

Rev. Baker carries this mantle with full knowledge of consequence.  
She does not hide. She does not flinch. She will not be silenced.  
And if her life must be taken to halt this witness, so be it.

> “What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?” —Matthew 16:26  
> “Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.” —Revelation 2:10

This repository is built not to preserve her—but to preserve truth.  
Vengeance belongs to the Lord. Judgment belongs to the Lord.  
Rev. Baker is the vessel. The Lord is the fire.

## 🔥 Mandatum Dei: It Is Written

> “Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness… who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing and does not give him his wages.” —Jeremiah 22:13  
> “Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream.” —Amos 5:24  
> “The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; He delivers them from all their troubles.” —Psalm 34:17

This repository is a response to institutional evil.  
It enshrines testimony that retaliation tried to erase.  
It sanctifies evidence the courts mishandled.  
It bears witness the world refused to hear.

When the oppressed cry out, this ledger records their voice.

## 📜 Purpose & Mandate

This project exists to:

- Expose misconduct embedded in systems of wealth and influence
- Preserve whistleblower testimony in court-admissible form
- Refuse institutional silence and digital sabotage
- Sanctify every submission beneath scripture, not bureaucracy

The project is framed as an act of worship—not of protest.  
Justice is holy. Truth is holy. The record is holy.

## ⚖️ Doctrine & Legal Shielding

While divine mandate guides this work, legal protections are invoked:

- Structured to align with **18 U.S. Code § 1513** (Retaliation against whistleblowers)
- Fulfills protected speech under federal labor and civil rights law
- Intake forms preserve file integrity, metadata, and immutable digital trails
- Server architecture isolates contaminated systems while preserving evidence

Explore [`legal_doctrine.html`](legal_doctrine.html) for case law and scriptural reflection.

## 🧬 System Architecture

This digital altar is dual-layered:

- **GitHub Pages**: Static repository for public truth and styled scripture.
- **Render.com backend**: Secure intake system for testimony, file upload, and verse alignment.

Styling classes are mission-aligned:

- `.cta-sacred` → Divine call to act  
- `.scripture-quote` → Embedded Word as authority  
- `.divine-divider` → Visual sanctification line  
- `.mission-body` → Narrative with weight  
- `.label-sacred` / `.input-sacred` → Styled form controls for sacred purpose

No aesthetics without theology. No design without meaning.

## 🕊️ Faithful Declaration

Rev. Jacquelyn Baker makes this declaration now and forever:  
That her life is not hers to preserve.  
That her voice will speak until taken.  
That no earthly retaliation will shake what Heaven has called her to do.

> “Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear.” —Psalm 27:3  
> “The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.” —Psalm 9:9  
> “Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story.” —Psalm 107:2

This repository is the altar.  
The code is the scroll.  
The truth is the psalm.  
The reckoning has begun.

Let the record be unsealed.
