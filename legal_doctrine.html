    <h2>📜 Invocation</h2>
    <div class="mission-body">
      Justice begins not with legislation but revelation. We summon spiritual truth to confront legal rot. When <strong>Our Savior Jesus Christ</strong> overturned tables in the temple, He declared sanctuaries cannot be bought. When Moses stood before Pharaoh, truth did not request permission—it demanded release. When Nathan said to David, “You are the man,” he wielded no badge, only prophetic fire. This archive follows that lineage. It is covenant enforcement. It is sacred confrontation. Its origin and mission are declared in <a href="readme.html" class="cta-sacred">readme.html</a>—the foundational scroll of identity and purpose.

    <h2>⚖️ Doctrine of Exposure</h2>
    Concealment is spiritual cowardice. This archive shines light on statutes that protect silence and systems that nourish corruption. Like prophets rebuking kings, we expose the hidden rot and strip legality of its false sanctity. Truth is not redacted—it is revealed.
  </section>

  <section class="micah-callout">
    <h2>⚔️ Doctrine of Vindication</h2>
    The truth-teller shall not be consumed. Just as Daniel faced lions without compromise, and <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> faced trial without silence, retaliation is the cost of righteousness—not its defeat. We cite law not for safety, but to provoke justice and defend divine testimony.
  </section>

  <section class="micah-callout">
    <h2>🛡️ Doctrine of Enforcement</h2>
    This archive is a battlefield, not a bookshelf. Every file is consecrated confrontation. Every testimony a spark of divine indictment. The law must bend to truth, not muzzle it. Like Elijah on Mount Carmel, we call systems to account and dare them to respond.

    <h2>🚨 Protective Clauses</h2>
    Testimony given here is under sacred guard. Retaliation is not just unlawful—it is cursed. To strike the witness is to strike the covenant. Federal law and divine justice stand in tandem. No truth-bearer shall be left unshielded.

  <section class="scripture-quote" id="benediction">
    <h2>🔥 Benediction</h2>
    Let judgment thunder from the heavens upon every hidden injustice. Let the righteous stand, though surrounded. Let every lie fall to dust. For we do not labor alone—<strong>Our Savior Jesus Christ</strong> is our advocate, and truth is the fire He kindles. This archive bears witness, not merely to corruption, but to righteousness in pursuit. So let the oppressed speak. Let justice roll like waters. Let the covenant be kept, even when the world forgets.
