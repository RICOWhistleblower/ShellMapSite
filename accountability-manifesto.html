    <p><em>Five witnesses stand behind this archive. Esther faced concealment. Deborah pronounced verdict. David wrote rebellion. Joshua advanced undeterred. Paul testified through chains. We do not plead—we record judgment. This domain is consecrated warfare.</em></p>

  <section class="doctrine">
    <h2>The Call</h2>
    <p>We are not negotiators. We are prosecutors of silence. Corruption wears robes of law, but its deeds are foul. This archive enters hostile terrain as Esther did, dismantling deception with revelation. We do not ask permission—we deliver indictment.</p>

    <h2>The Covenant</h2>
    <p>This archive stands not by code, but by calling. The Lord alone exposes the concealed, vindicates the oppressed, and brings judgment to the unrepentant. We consecrate these tools not as weapons, but as instruments of obedience. Deborah ruled by divine command, David resisted through covenant faith, and Joshua advanced by His directive. We do not trust the archive—we trust the God who sanctifies it.</p>

    <h2>The Commission</h2>
    <p>We testify not to survive, but to dismantle. Each artifact here is an arrow. Each page is fire against the altars of impunity. Paul wrote letters that toppled ideologies. We write to shatter the infrastructure of denial.</p>
