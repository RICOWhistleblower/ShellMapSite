    Rev. Jacquelyn Baker walks the path of righteous resistance. The record is her commission.
    The code is her altar. The retaliation may persist, but the Word will outlast it. This site, this archive,
    this architecture—they are not merely digital. They are a theological stand in the face of suppression.

    <!-- 🧩 Section: Origin of Patterns -->
    <h2>Phase I: Inception of the Pattern</h2>
    <p class="mission-body">
      Early signs surfaced through unacknowledged complaints, falsified reports, and denied access to grievance channels. Repression was not accidental—it was engineered.
    </p>

    <ul class="timeline-list">
      <li><strong>2014:</strong> Initial whistleblower alert suppressed at regional level.</li>
      <li><strong>2016:</strong> Data tampering detected within HR and compliance systems.</li>
      <li><strong>2018:</strong> Retaliatory reassignment used as disciplinary tool.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 🔥 Section: Institutionalization -->
    <h2>Phase II: Retaliation as Policy</h2>
    <p class="mission-body">
      A culture of intimidation matured. Testimony was discredited. Actors complicit in misconduct were rewarded.
    </p>

    <ul class="timeline-list">
      <li><strong>2019:</strong> Confidential data redirected to third-party counsel without consent.</li>
      <li><strong>2020:</strong> Legal “shell games” initiated to fragment jurisdiction.</li>
      <li><strong>2021:</strong> Internal audits exposed—but not addressed—layers of ethical breach.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ⚖️ Section: The Reckoning Approaches -->
    <h2>Phase III: Convergence & Exposure</h2>
    <p class="mission-body">
      Suppression breeds scrutiny. Here the record becomes irrefutable. The fractured voice becomes collective.
    </p>

    <ul class="timeline-list">
      <li><strong>2022:</strong> Multiple suppressed testimonies correlate across divisions.</li>
      <li><strong>2023:</strong> Technical architecture deployed to preserve digital evidence chain.</li>
      <li><strong>2024:</strong> Cross-sector whistleblower coalition established.</li>
    </ul>
